# Real-Time Object Detection using YOLOv10

## Overview
This project implements a real-time object detection system using YOLOv10. Designed as part of the IE Deep Learning initiative, the system processes video streams and images to detect objects with high accuracy and speed.

## Features
- Real-time object detection on live video feeds.
- High accuracy with YOLOv10 architecture.
- Easy integration with various input sources.
- Optimized for performance and scalability.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- TensorFlow/PyTorch (depending on your implementation)
- Other dependencies as listed in `requirements.txt`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/object_detection_realtime.git
   ```
2. Change to the project directory:
   ```
   cd object_detection_realtime
   ```
3. Install the required packages:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage
1. Prepare your video/image source.
2. Run the detection script:
   ```
   python detect.py --source path/to/your/input
   ```
3. Adjust detection parameters in the configuration files for optimal performance.

## Configuration
- Configure detection thresholds, model paths, and other settings in the `config.yaml` file.
